"@VirginAmerica classiq, luv Virgin America. Greetingz",positive
@USAirways so you don't have a pilot now for #clt ✈ #ord for at least another hour. Why on earth would you board the plane? Makes no sense!,negative
@AmericanAir nah u boofin u dont talk like any humans i know. Respond like u actually have a brain. And again i dont want customer relations,negative
@USAirways Finally back on board.  Door was closed only to be reopened because we need fuel. You think someone wd have thought of it earlier,negative
"@SouthwestAir Great, thank you. Best of luck dealing with this horrible winter.",positive

@united Hi there bag ID is UA6016053916 can you update me and explain why is occurred when I arrived 4 hours before flight!,negative

"@JetBlue ""Goodwill"" now at $125.00.  $27,000 x ? = Fine   Still want your new CEO to make a public apology to all passengers of flight 136",negative
“@USAirways: @TMadCLE We don't like to hear this. We're sorry that it's taking so long to get through.” Stop sending generic responses,negative
@USAirways quit being cheap and hire some call center employees. It shouldn't take half a day to call you,negative

@USAirways then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!!,negative
@united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.,negative
@JetBlue #1680 Super smooth flight and landing. Nicely done.,positive
